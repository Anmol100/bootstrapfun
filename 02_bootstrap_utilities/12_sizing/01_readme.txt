Sizing

It is used to size the element. By using sizing utility,
ou can easily make an element as wide or as tall (relative to its parent) with our width
 and height utilities. Includes support for 25%, 50%, 75%, and 100% by default.

Width and height utilities are generated from the $sizes Sass map in _variables.scss.
 You can modify these values when you need to generate different utilities here.
