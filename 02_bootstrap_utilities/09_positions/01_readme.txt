Positions

Bootstrap position utility is used to quickly place a component outside the normal document flow.
There are several fixed and sticky position classes are available.

Fixed top

It is used to position an element at the top of the viewport, from edge to edge. You can also add some additional CSS.

Syntax:

<div class="fixed-top">...</div>

Fixed Bottom

It is used to position an element at the bottom of the viewport from edge to edge. You can also add some additional CSS.

Syntax:

<div class="fixed-bottom">...</div>

Sticky Top

Sticky top is used to position an element at the top of the viewport, from edge to edge, but only when you scroll past it. The .sticky-top utility uses CSS's position: sticky, which isn't fully supported in all browsers.

Syntax:

<div class="sticky-top">...</div>
