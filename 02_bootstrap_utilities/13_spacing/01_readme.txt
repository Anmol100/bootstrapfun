Spacing

Spacing utility is used to assign the responsive-friendly margin or padding
values to an element or a subset of its sides with shorthand classes.
It includes individual properties, all properties and vertical and horizontal properties.

It classes are built from a default Sass map ranging from .25rem to 3rem.
