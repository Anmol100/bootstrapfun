Align Self

The align-self-utility is used on flexbox items to individually change their alignment on the cross axis.
You can choose from the same options as align-items: start, end, center, baseline, or stretch (browser default).

Example:

<div class="align-self-start">Aligned flex item</div>
<div class="align-self-end">Aligned flex item</div>
<div class="align-self-center">Aligned flex item</div>
<div class="align-self-baseline">Aligned flex item</div>
<div class="align-self-stretch">Aligned flex item</div>
