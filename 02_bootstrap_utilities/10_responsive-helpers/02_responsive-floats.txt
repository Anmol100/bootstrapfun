Responsive Floats

These utility classes are used to float an element to the left or right, or disable floating,
based on the current viewport size using the CSS float property.
!important is included to avoid specificity issues.

These use the same viewport width breakpoints as the grid system.

There are two similar non-responsive Sass mixins (float-left and float-right) are also available.

Syntax:

<div class="float-left">Float left on all viewport sizes</div><br>
<div class="float-right">Float right on all viewport sizes</div><br>
<div class="float-none">Don't float on all viewport sizes</div><br>
<div class="float-sm-left">Float left on viewports sized SM (small) or wider</div><br>
<div class="float-md-left">Float left on viewports sized MD (medium) or wider</div><br>
<div class="float-lg-left">Float left on viewports sized LG (large) or wider</div><br>
<div class="float-xl-left">Float left on viewports sized XL (extra-large) or wider</div><br>
 
How to use it:

// Related simple non-responsive mixins
.element {
  @include float-left;
}
.another-element {
  @include float-right;
}
