Responsive Helpers

Responsive helper utility is used to allow browsers to determine video or slideshow
dimensions according to the width of their containing block in a way that it will properly scale on any device.

You have to apply rules directly on <iframe>, <embed>, <video>, and <object> elements;
 optionally use an explicit descendant class .embed-responsive-item when you want to match the styling for other attributes.

Note: You don't need to include frameborder="0" in your <iframe>s as we override that for you.

Syntax:

<div class="embed-responsive embed-responsive-16by9">
  <iframe class="embed-responsive-item" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/zpOULjyy-n8?rel=0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
</div>

You can customize aspect ratios with modifier classes:

<!-- 21:9 aspect ratio -->

<div class="embed-responsive embed-responsive-21by9">
  <iframe class="embed-responsive-item" src="..."></iframe>
</div>

<!-- 16:9 aspect ratio -->

<div class="embed-responsive embed-responsive-16by9">
  <iframe class="embed-responsive-item" src="..."></iframe>
</div>

<!-- 4:3 aspect ratio -->

<div class="embed-responsive embed-responsive-4by3">
  <iframe class="embed-responsive-item" src="..."></iframe>
</div>

<!-- 1:1 aspect ratio -->

<div class="embed-responsive embed-responsive-1by1">
  <iframe class="embed-responsive-item" src="..."></iframe>
</div>
