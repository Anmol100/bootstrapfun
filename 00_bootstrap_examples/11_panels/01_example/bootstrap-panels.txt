Bootstrap Panels
In Bootstrap, a panel is a bordered box with some padding around its element.
The panel components are used when you want to put your DOM component in a box.

The class .panel is used within the <div> element to create Bootstrap panels.
The content inside the panel has a .panel-body class.

Generally a panel contains three parts:

Panel header
Panel content
Panel footer
