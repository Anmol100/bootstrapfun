Bootstrap supports for images. There are three classes in Bootstrap that can be used to apply some simple style to the images.

The following classes add style to the images:

Classes	Uses
.img-rounded	  It adds border-radius:6px to give the image rounded corners.
.img-circle	    It makes the entire image round by adding border-radius:500px.
.img-thumbnail	It adds a bit of padding and a gray border.
