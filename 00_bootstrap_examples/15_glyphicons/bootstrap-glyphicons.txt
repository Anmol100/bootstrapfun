Bootstrap Glyphicons
Glyphicons are the icon fonts that are used in web projects. Bootstrap provides 260 Glyphicons from the Glyphicons Halflings set.

Some examples of Glyphicons are:

Envelope glyphicon
Print glyphicon
Search glyphicon
Download glyphicon etc.
Glyphicons Syntax
<span class="glyphicon glyphicon-name"></span>
 
To create the desired Glyphicon, the "name" part of the syntax must be replaced accordingly.

For example: If you want to create "envelope" glyphicon, then you must write the following syntax:

<span class="glyphicon glyphicon-envelope"></span>
